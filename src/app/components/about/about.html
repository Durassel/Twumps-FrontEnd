	<p>Our objective is to carry out an unconventional and creative project that is out of the ordinary. We found many ideas but only one stood out from the crowd : create some <b>interesting statistics about Donald Trump</b>.</p>

	<h3>How can we do that ?</h3>
	<p>Donald Trump loves to use <b>social media</b> to communicate about his projects and beliefs. Especially <b>Twitter</b> that he uses very frequently. It is a simple way to express short ideas.</p>

	<p>Our solution is to use <b>Donald Trump's Twitter account</b> to make various statistics in order to learn more about him and his behaviour. Thanks to Twitter, we can take his tweets and use them for <b>analysis</b>. For example, itâ€™s possible to count how many times one word is used, or find the lexical field employed by Donald Trump.</p>

	<h3>How can we get Donald Trump's tweets ?</h3>
	<p>Twitter has got an API that allows to make requests in order to retrieve some data. The problem is that we can only make <b>3200 requests per month</b>. That is a huge problem for us, because Donald Trump has twitted more than <b>35 000 tweets</b>.</p>

	<h3>What is the solution ?</h3>
	<p>To solve this problem, we used a <b>Python script</b> to browse all Donald Trump's tweets (Twitter scrapping), i.e. it automatically reads Donald Trump's profile, in order to retrieve the data. This method allowed us to create a first database.</p>

	<p>Tweets information about the writter was not very accurate, so our analysis could be incorrect. That's why we contact Ben SUGERMAN who created this website : <b><a href="didtrumptweetit.com">didtrumptweetit.com</a></b>. It distinguishes tweets <b>written by Donald Trump or his team</b>, in the form of a percentage of accuracy. He shared his database with us, which we <b>merged</b> with the one we had.</p>
